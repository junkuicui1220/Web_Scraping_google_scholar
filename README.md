# Web_Scraping_google_scholar

There are two stages

Stage 1: running the abc.py will return the research article's title, author name, and urls from Google Scholar and save it to a designated Excel file.


Stage 2: running dec.py will return the abstract of the research article under the corresponding link from stage 1, and save the abstract in a new Excel file.
